<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a dedicated researcher advancing AI in healthcare, with a particular focus on Medical Image Analysis and Trustworthy AI. Currently at Henry Ford Health, I explore innovative AI-driven healthcare solutions, specializing in medical image analysis and reliable AI systems. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Wayne State University, where my research has been published in top venues including MICCAI, WACV, NeurIPS, IJCAI, and ECML.

My research focuses on two main areas: Medical Image Analysis with Deep Learning (automatic medical image segmentation, multi-modal learning, foundation models in medical domain, clinical-oriented AI solutions for healthcare) and Trustworthy AI (fairness, explainability, robustness). I strive to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI and practical healthcare applications. If you're interested in Medical Image Analysis, Trustworthy AI, or Generative AI, I welcome collaboration opportunities.
