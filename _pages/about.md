<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a dedicated researcher advancing AI in healthcare, with a particular focus on Medical Image Analysis and Trustworthy AI. Currently, 
I develop innovative AI-driven healthcare solutions at Henry Ford Health. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Wayne State University, 
where I specialized in AI methodologies for medical applications. My research contributions have been widely recognized, with publications 
in top AI and medical imaging conferences, including NeurIPS, IJCAI, ECML, MICCAI, and WACV, among others. With a strong passion for research 
and a commitment to real-world impact, I strive to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI and practical healthcare applications.

If you are interested in Medical Image Analysis, Trustworthy AI, or Generative AI, feel free to reach out via email—I am always open to collaboration!
